Twitterのシャドウバンについてのまとめ.


## Twitterシャドウバンとは {#twitterシャドウバンとは}

Twitterシャドウバンは俗語でありTwitter公式ではその用語はない.

さらにはチェックサイトが2018年くらいにできてそれで用語が定着していったがTwitterの仕様は常に変わっているため現状の規制と乖離しはじめている.

たとえばSearchBanやGhost BanはEntities(Text/URL/Media)ごとに規制されるようになった. そしてSearch BanがかかることとGhost Banがかかることは同じなので両者を分ける必要もないかもしれない. Reply Deboostingについてはかつては攻撃的な内容を含むだったが, 2022現在はヌード, 暴力, センシティブの３つに細分化されている.

また2020年ごろから，アカウントをロックや凍結をするのではなくツイートを隠したり通知規制をするようになった気がする. それはコロナ流行やアメリカ大統領選挙にあわせて都市伝説やデマを拡散するTwitter Botが大量生産されたための対策のように思われる. つまり本人は今までどおり情報発信をしていてもタイムラインに流れなかったりリプライが届かなかった通知欄に表示されなかったり. その変化によって最近(2022現在)より一層このあたりのアルゴリズムが変化している.


## shadowban.euによるシャドウバンの分類 {#shadowban-dot-euによるシャドウバンの分類}

本家サイトはすでに閉鎖済み. 4つに規制を分類している.

-   Search Suggestion Ban
    -   This type of ban causes an account to not populate search suggestions and people search results when it is searched for while being logged out. Twitter seems to take tie strength or a similar metric into account. While an account may be suggested to users you are strongly tied to, it may not be shown to others.
-   Search Ban
    -   This type of ban causes your tweets to be hidden from the search results entirely, no matter whether the quality filter is turned on or off. This behavior includes hashtags as well. This type of ban seems to be temporally limited for active accounts.
-   Ghost Ban
    -   This is what is referred to as conventional shadowban or thread banning as well. It comprises a search ban while threads are completely ripped apart by hiding reply tweets of the affected user to others. Everything will look perfectly normal to the affected user but many others will not be able to see reply tweets of the affected user at all. Reasons for this ban include behavior like excessive tweeting or following. Again, this type of ban seems to be temporally limited for active accounts.
-   Reply Deboosting
    -   If Twitter's signals determine that an account might engage in harmful behavior, Twitter hides their replies behind a barrier and only loads them when "Show more replies" is clicked. This behavior is personalized, i.e. Twitter does not hide the tweets of accounts you follow. We therefore use an unbiased reference account without followings in order to determine whether tweets within a thread can be retrieved without clicking "Show more replies" from its view. In some cases, Twitter classifies accounts as offensive. In this case, replies are hidden behind a second barrier within the "Show more replies" section.
    -   The outcome of this test may depend on the conversation which we found one of your tweets in. For testing, we take your latest reply tweet that is not within a conversation you started. Note that test results are cached for a short period of time.
    -   A failure to test is neither a positive nor a negative test result. This test relies on some conditions that are not fulfilled by all accounts. In some cases, we cannot test for purely technical reasons.

-   長期に渡る規制は14:00にステータスが変化することが多い.
-   トリガーとなったツイートから24時間, 72時間で規制解除されることがおおい.
