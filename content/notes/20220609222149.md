## 要約の翻訳 {#要約の翻訳}

この世の中は、悲しみや苦しみが満ち溢れる世の中です。それは欲深いエリートたちが作り上げた世界です。世の中は彼らのせいで家畜そのものになってしまいました。ある一部の人たちのみが富を築き、彼らは貧しい人々から金をむしりとり、お互いを争わせ、お金の無駄遣いをさせ、そして管理社会にいることに気づかせないために、洗脳をしています。エリートたちは、ある一部の人間しか成功できないような経済システムを作り上げました。エリートたちは、あらゆる方法であなたを奴隷にし、虐待しています。地球は人間の農場となり、エリートのネットワークが私たち全体を搾取しています。

人間は、もともと動物的で本能で生きていましたが、進化の最終段階で高い知能を手に入れました。人間の脳は、理性と本能の2つに分かれています。脳科学的にいうと、前頭前皮質と辺縁系です。前頭前皮質は、複雑な計算や問題解決を得意とし、一方辺縁系は食事やセックスなどの本能的な欲望をコントロールしています。本能は、難しいものを嫌い、あらゆる刺激に反応し、強力なパワーを持っています。理性は論理的ですが、力が弱いです。理性と本能の戦闘力の差は歴然です。600万年かけて人類の頭に刻みつけられたもので、理性は本能に勝てません。理性は合理性を利用して本能をコントロールする必要がありますが、情報が激増する現代社会では本能をコントロールすることが難しくなってきています。私たちの行動は、不合理な本能に依然として強く影響を受けています。部族の本能は、部外者を信頼せず、彼らと敵対する傾向があります。たくさんの情報によって違いを生み出すことで、エリートは私たちの本能に訴えて争わせようとしています。私たちは、自分で考える時間をつくり、内省や瞑想を通じて、自己認識を深める必要があります。自己認識は、私たちが本能を超越して、啓発られた存在になることを可能にする唯一のツールです。

教育について、学校は社会に出るまでのほとんどの時間を過ごす場所ですが、そこは子供たちを洗脳する場所です。子供のころは、みなクリエイティブで好奇心旺盛で、生き生きとしています。好きなことをみつけて一日一日を全力で楽しんでいます。夢中になれることを追求し、やり続けさせたらきっとすごい人間になる可能性は高いはずです。しかし、エリートたちはそれを望みません。なので学校では子供に課題をたくさん与え忙しくさせて、みなに同じような無駄な知識を与えます。そして、社会にでるころには、家畜として完成させられるのです。あなたエリートたちが作り上げた世界がすべてだと思い、自分がその作られた世界の中にいるのにも関わらず、それが理解できないほど洗脳されています。人間は自分で意識して行動し好きなことを見つけ追求しなければ自分を見失います。そうなればエリートの格好の奴隷となります。人間をそのようにさせることがエリートの好む社会なのです。忙しくちゃんと働いて何も考えずにそしてなんの生き甲斐も知らず、ただ物事を復習して学習してくれるだけの真面目な人が欲しいんです。自由で創造性がある人間なんて、エリートたちは欲しくありません。

次にメディアです。メディアは主に３つの目標のために利用されています。はじめの１つは、気を散らすこと。人間の注意を散漫させるため画面の中で作られた世界を眺めさせ、現実を見ないようにさせるのです。2つ目の目標は、映画、ニュース、新聞、雑誌、ドキュメンタリーなどを通じて、あなたに情報の読み違いをさせることです。実際の出来事には目を向けさせないように、プロパガンダと嘘の情報を植え付けるています。わざと事件を起こして、悪者をつくり、間違った方向に注意を向けさせる。3つ目は、メディアによって願望を掻き立て、あなたを表面的で愚かな人間に変えることです。必要のないものに富を使うように説得されます。あなたは美人な広告モデルを起用して自分の不満を感じるために洗脳され、あなたが住んでいる世界を見るのではなく、自分の人生をすべて鏡で見ているように仕向けます。

3S政策というものが戦後から日本にはあります。スクリーン・スポーツ・セックスのSです。現在だと、3Sに加えて、酒とSNSが加わるかもしれません。映画、テレビ、ゲーム、Youtube、野球、サッカー、インターネットポルノなど、全て政治や世の中の出来事に目を向けなくするために、奨励されます。エリートは、あなたを混乱させ、あなたの周りの破壊と悲惨さに無関心に保つために使用します。

また、ひとりひとりに違いを生み出すことで、エリートは競争を奨励します。一人ひとりを切り離したいのです。人種、宗教、民族的および国家的背景、仕事、収入、学歴、社会的地位、性別、など。そういうものを産ませて貧困層と中間層の間で争わせ、消耗させて、それをエリートたちは高みの見物をしながら搾取したいのです。

このように、この世界はあなたに対する陰謀であり、人間としてのあなたの潜在能力を完全に解き放つことを防ぐ陰謀であり、あなたを家畜にして、従順で、哀れな、無知な生き物に変える陰謀です。ですから、自分の行動に意識的になり、周りに流されるのではなく自分の考えで行動する、毎日少し瞑想し、画面を見ることをやめて、エリートがあなたを機械に変えないようにしてください。あなた自身のために学び、メディアが語るでたらめを信じるのをやめてください。そして、私たちは一人であり、すべて異なっていることを理解し、思いやりをもってまわりと接すること。


## 原文 {#原文}

> Dear future generations, That’s an anonymous message for you.
> Be careful you have been born in a world that it’s very hostile sad and full of misery and suffering you live in a world where a network of greedy people and institutions are secretly ruling and exploiting the rest of us. You will be enslaved and mistreated in every possible way. The earth has become a human farm and a network of elites are exploiting all of us
> In this video, dear future generations, I would like to warn you about the dangers of the world you are living in.Although you will be billions of human beings sharing the planet you will be ruled and exploited only by a few.
> Nowadays, only a handful of persons accumulate the same wealth that the rest of us. This people have destroyed our world and will control every aspect of your lives. They will steal your wealth, will persuade you to kill each other, will convince you to spend your little money and things you don’t need , and will come you down to such an extent that you won’t realize how you are being routed by a few. That’s the world where you have been born and you, future generations, will become cattle like most of unless you listen our messages.
> First thing, we should warn you about, it’s about yourself, about your human nature. We, humans were irrational animals driven by instincts only a few hundred thousand years ago. Although in the last stages of our evolution we developed a high intelligence these instincts still play a strong influence over our behavior like animals we are. By nature, tribal creatures prone to not trust outsiders and get into conflict with them. We are territorial.We are possessive. We have strong. Ego is huge sexual appetite and all these instincts will make you prone to fight and compete with other fellow human beings to prevent your animal nature. From taking control of yourself, you will need to meditate you will need to spend some time a day looking inwardly and becoming aware of yourself. Self-awareness is the only tool that will allow you to transcend your irrational animal nature and become an enlightened being. Dear future generations, unless you become aware of your own existence, chaos suffering and destruction will reign your lives
> Another thing we should warn you about is the educational system. The school it’s a place where you will spend most of your life till you turn 18. The goal of this institution is to dumb you down during your youth you will feel furious about the world. You will ask yourself many questions and you will have an insatiable craving for learning. You will have the potential to become an artist a wise human being but that is something the elites don’t want you to become, and therefore they will place you in the indoctrination system where you will be kept busy learning irrelevant things to ensure that by the time you are an adult. You don’t have a fucking clue of how the world works. You will be so ignorant that you won’t even realize that you are being exploited before your eyes. So, dear future generations, you will definitely be idiots if you will only have learned what has been taught to you in the schools unless you do research by ourselves. You will be ignorant creatures who will destroy themselves.
> But I’ll tell you what they don’t want. They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking .They don’t want well informed well educated people capable of critical thinking they’re not interested in that that doesn’t help them that’s against their interests. That’s right you know something they don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table to figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard thirty fucking years ago. They don’t want that you know what they want. They want obedient workers. Obedient workers people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay the longer hours to reduce benefits the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears.
> The third thing we should warn you about. It’s the media programming you will see that in the hours. There are electronic devices transmitting moving images and all kind of programs you will soon realize that the people spend most of their times watching at these screens. Be careful unless you want to become a cattle. Don’t do like them and now I will tell you why these devices are used by the elites to achieve basically three goals.
> The first one is to distract you. The TV is a great invention, very useful for the elites since they can achieve to have all the population distracted. Staring at a screen and attained with a virtual reality which will ensure that you don’t pay attention to the real world. Your distraction give the elites the chance to exploit you. You both sit there day after day night after night for ages colors Creed’s where all you know you’re beginning to believe the illusions meaning. Here you’re, they’re getting to think the tube is reality and that’s your own lives are unreal you do whatever the tube tells you. You dress like the tube you like like a tube. You raise your camera like a tube. You even think like the tube this is less than this you maniacs in God’s name you people are the real thing we got.
> The second goal of the TV is to miss inform you through movies, news and documentaries. The elites will give you a fake view of the world you live in. They don’t want you to understand the reality. And therefore they will implant in your mind lies and propaganda. In order to turn you into an ignorant submissive citizen unable to comprehend the world around him and then able to become aware of his condition of slave.
> Don’t you want the truth, go to your guru, go to yourself because that’s the only place you’re ever going to find any real truth. You know, they’re going to get any two of us will tell you anything you want to hear we live.
> Another application of the TV will be to bombard you with images that will implant and your nine values complexes and aspirations that will turn you into a superficial and stupid human being through the TV in the media. You will be programmed like a robot to develop behaviors that benefits the elites. You will be persuaded to spend your wealth in things that you don’t need. You will be brainwashed to feel unhappy with yourself so that you will spend all your life looking yourself on the mirrors instead of looking the world you live in. It will be implanted means that will keep you focused into relevant things that nothing in the scheme of the entire world.
> Another thing the elites will do is to use propaganda lights and false flag terror attacks to try to implant in your mind filtered towards other fellow human beings. The elites have created an unfair economical system that only benefits a few and to prevent the masses from raising against them. They will try to keep you divided and confronted with each other. Be careful and be aware of the intentions of the countless messages promoting hatred that will reduce since the first day you will be born the strength of the elites lies precisely on your hatred towards your fellow human beings.
> Now to balance the scale I’d like to talk about some things that bring us together things that point out our similarities instead of our differences because that’s all you ever hear about in this countries are differences that’s all the media and the politicians are ever talking about the things that separate us things that make us different from one another. That’s the way the ruling class operates in any society they try to divide the rest of the people to keep it lower in the middle classes fighting with each other so that they the rich can run off with all the fucking money. Fairly simple thing happens to work. Do you know anything different that’s what they’re going to talk about. Race, religion, ethnic and national background, jobs, income, education, social status, sexuality, anything you can do keep us fighting with each other so they bake.
> Finally you will live in a society that will surround you with countless distractions. The elites will want you to spend your life entertained distracted unaware of the important political events that are unfolding around you they will surround you with amazing video games, with virtual reality, with drugs, with big variety of TV programs pornography and distractions of all kind you will be exploited since the first day you are born and entertainments it’s one of the tools, the elites will use to keep you distracted and apathetic towards the destruction and misery around you.
> Why is that? It’s the Roman circus. What does the Emperor do? The people become resting, when the people are asking questions and when the people don’t like the policies of the Emperor. He sends them to the circus, he creates the circus he builds, a giant Colosseum and he begins to throw the Christians to the Lions he has great chariot races, and football games and basketball games, all to keep the idiots preoccupied with things that don’t mean anything scheme of the entire world, so that they don’t have the time to learn with the truthiness, so they don’t ever get smart enough to learn how to being, so they don’t ever question.
> So dear future generations, as you can see, this world is a conspiracy against you a conspiracy to prevent you from unleashing your full potential as a human being, a conspiracy to turn you into cattle , into submissive, a pathetic, ignorant creatures. So future generations, if you don’t follow our advice , you will surely become ignorant like most of us and destruction and suffering will keep plaguing the earth we have destroyed a planet because we have been victim of this conspiracy which has prevented most of us to learn the right knowledge and wake up and you, future generations, will surely follow the same path unless you pay heed to our advice.
> So please become self-aware and meditate a little bit every day, stop watching screens and don’t let the elites to turn you into a machine. Learn for yourself and stop believing the bullshit that the corporate media will tell.
> Finally, dear future generations, you will need to be compassionate. Don’t look at other disoriented human being what a turd .You need to understand that we are all one, we are all different, manifestations of a same being only ideologies, prejudices, and fear separates us and hating each other. It’s the most stupid mistake humanity have done since the beginning of times.
> Now humans of the future, don’t do the same mistake. Don’t commit the same errors of killing each other like we did. Be united, spread love, since war is in division, as you have seen have destroyed our world. Dear future generations, I hope you learn from the mistakes of our past. I am sure you can do better than us.
> Good luck. We are anonymous, and we are awake we do not forgive and we do not forget so expect us.
